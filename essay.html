				Coding is like a complicated game of chess.

			<p>
				While some people would compare learning to code to learning a new language, I'd say it is more like learning a new game. The game, however, has a ridiculous amount of rules, and it does not expect you to know all of them.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my favourite games is a game called <a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>. Explained simply, the game is about mining resources like copper and oil and parsing them through a system with the end goal of researching and building a rocket. Factorio tickles the same parts in my brain that writing code does.			</p>
			<p>
				I could, and would, discuss for hours the similarities between things like “Assembling Machines” and constructors, Visual hierarchies, and scaling, but for brevity, <a href="https://www.codingblocks.net/programming/coding-lessons-from-factorio/">I will leave that to someone else</a>. The point is, most of the challenges are more akin to a game like Factorio, and not problems like your car breaking down. In all three cases, you are in over your head, you have got about 15 guides open, and it is mostly trial and error. The differences are simple. The stakes, the investment, and the outcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>The stakes</strong> are incredibly low for coding. Make a mistake? Walk it back, load the last backup, ctrl+z till things work again. If your engine goes up in smoke, you might have just made three parallel (and costly) issues. <br><strong>The investment</strong> is also low. A couple of hours and maybe a licensing cost, as opposed to a couple of thousand smackers. On top of that, the type of investment is far more connected. You do not care to understand how the engineer that designed your engine thought about its ergonomics. You just want it to work. A piece of code is far more personal, and you almost grow attached to it. <br> At the end of it all, what is <strong>the outcome</strong>? On the one hand, you have an impersonal product, now back to working order, a return to zero. On the other, you have a new piece of art, a complexly tied knot.

				It's Not All Roses And Sunshine
			</h2>
			<p>
				While programming is rewarding and fun, it suffers from a couple of seemingly needless challenges. They are in no way unique to coding, but they still present themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				IHNIWTF is going on sometimes. Abbreviations and acronyms are everywhere in code. ask someone unfamiliar with HTML what &lt;Header&gt; means, they’ll be pretty close. But &lt;p&gt;? &lt;div&gt;? CSS is a bit easier, by using plain text to explain itself. while its not always clear, its far better than HTML’s:  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8&gt;. Don’t even get me started on Java.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes the solutions feel kinda counterintuitive. For the most part, it's pretty straightforward. want a paragraph? Input in a paragraph. Want a navigation menu? Input a navigation menu. Do you want to centre an element within another element? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6810031/css-center-element-within-a-div-element">Here is a 20 line piece of code with 4 different classes</a>, and it doesn’t even work because your element is relative. While I really appreciate having the freedom to do essentially anything I want, it gets frustrating at times. I think this is the main reason sites like <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> exists.

				Final Thoughts
			</h2>
			<img src="img/Graphtodefineme.png" alt="A drawn graph, the Y axis reads 'Willingness to opine on the topic', the x axis reads 'knowledge of that topic'. The graph goes up to a peak, down to a valley, and then shoots up. On the peak, there are two labels, one reading 'mount stupid' and the other reading 'me'. The purpouse of the graph is to show that the person coding may not know a lot about coding, but is willing to share their opinion as to if they were an expert. It's not quite self deperecative but its intended to be quippy.">
			<p>
				coding is the exact type of challenge i like. Not only are you over your head, you are essentially at the bottom of the ocean. But instead of nightmare fuel, you're given an oxygen tank, and essentially all the time in the world. They're not trying to kill you.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love coding. It's super rewarding and fun. While it's got a high mental barrier to entry, it's lots of fun (and productive!). The following graph should clear the air about where I am in my coding journey.
