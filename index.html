			<h2>The Purpouse of this Website</h2>
			<p>
				This site has multiple purpouses and will most likely show up in at least a couple of places. Primarily, at the time of making, it is for my
				final assignment for my "DATA1200-1 21H Webutvikling og inkluderende design" class at OsloMet. The website will contain projects I have worked on in other classes. The site should hopefully
				be fairly easy to navigate, as well as being fairly consistent visually (other than the last page). If you have stumbled opon this page, and you don't know who I am, 
				that would not be intended, and that would probably be bad.

			<h2>Different Pages</h2>
			<p>
				The site consists of a couple of pages. The <a href="index.html">main page</a> is the primary landing spot for the site. It contains a cool graphic, and is
				quite a bit more meta than the rest of the site.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="essay.html">essay</a> page contains a reflection text. It describes some challenges I've encountered going from working to getting back into academia.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="acessibility.html">acessibility</a> page contains a text considering the different decisions that need to made in order to make the site acesssable.
				While I have no issue using the site, people using other or older browsers, and people with diabilites might struggle. Keeping some simple design decisions in
				mind makes the site substantially easier to navigate. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a href="society.html">society</a> page contains one of the assignments for "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers". The purpouse of this page
				is simply to show that I understand the concepts of integrating links. The text itself isn't revolutionary.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <a href="Life-Tips.html">fun</a> page is a suprise for you! It contains a couple of minor animations and whatever I feel like tossing in there. It's not meant
				to be of the highest quality, but it merely shows off some cool things you can do with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript ;).
