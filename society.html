			<h2>
				How would you define Fake News? What do you think are its defining characteristics?
				Try to create your own definition of what qualifies as Fake News.
			</h2>
			<p>
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news">Fake News</a>
				can be defined as stories to mislead or misrepresent in the hopes of 
				achieving ulterior motives. Fake news has 2 primary characteristics, 
				<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002764219878224">intent and falsehood</a>.
				There must be an intention to lie.
			</p>
			<p>
				Firstly, the intention of the person or people spreading the fake news. This is key,
				as simply not knowing better or guessing wouldn’t qualify as fake news per se. It may be misleading,
				lying and even inflammatory, while still not being fake news. Fake News needs to be deliberate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, the news needs to be at the very least misleading. It doesn’t have to be untrue,
				but it does need to spin a narrative inaccurately. Heavily implying is enough to be considered fake news.
				Trying to draw connections from unrelated things, fabricating intent, changing timelines,
				lying about cause or effect, and factual inaccuracy are hallmarks of fake news.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, a lot of things that we call “fake news” are very rarely fake news.
				Just because something is misinformation, doesn’t mean it’s fake news.
				Just because something stands in opposition to journalistic integrity,
				doesn’t need to mean it’s fake news. It can be biased, paid for,
				and provide inaccurate information, and still, just be called <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-020-01075-9">advertising</a>.

			<h2>What can you do as an individual to help tackle the problem of mis- and disinformation on the internet,
				both in terms of your personal and your professional life?</h2>
			<p>
				Sadly, this is a tragedy of the commons. One individual sadly can’t make a dent in such a large issue.
				 Misinformation is sadly something that people, in general,
				  are pretty okay with. Most people don’t have time to cross-examine and triple check all their information,
				   and being proven right feels better. There are a couple of things that can be done, however.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Some of the things we can do to prevent falling for and spreading misinformation are relatively simple.
				 Confirming the source, cross-examination, reading attentively and controlling our biases are simple tips to avoid it generally.
				 There are even tools like <a href="https://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> that do this for you.
				  More importantly than this, I would say that voting with your click is incredibly important.
				   Don’t support or read articles from places that regularly shovel fake news. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Breaking news is the worst arbiter of fake news. The amount of conspiracy and lies we accept is incredible.
				The media in general don’t approach this stuff from “we don’t know much, but we have our theories”
				but rather from hyper confidence, pretending to know all the facts. Avoid breaking news at all costs.
				It’s so easy to get swept away. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Avoiding the production of misinformation is far simpler.
				More important than simply figuring out what you are saying is correct,
				is how you are presenting it. Reporters love clinging to the most outlandish
				information of stories and have often made up their minds before writing.
				They know as well as us that boring things don't sell. Make the information
				you put out easy to understand, and almost entirely matter of fact. If you
				say “There are possibilities that there are aliens among us”, the news will
				go with “There (...) are aliens among us”.
